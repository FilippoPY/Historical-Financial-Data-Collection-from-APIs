# Historical Financial Data Collection from APIs

This repository is part of my DevOps assignment.  
The goal of the project is to set up a workflow that automatically collects and updates historical financial data from different APIs, storing it in a structured format for later analysis.

## Project Scope
- Automate the retrieval of historical stock and financial market data.
- Demonstrate integration between Jira, GitHub repository, and GitHub Actions.
- Provide an initial DevOps pipeline that updates this README with logs of activity.

## How it works
1. A branch is created in GitHub linked to a Jira Issue (e.g., `PROJ-123-update-readme`).
2. A GitHub Action workflow updates the section below with activity logs or status.
3. Future improvements may include connecting to real financial APIs.

## Activity Log

**Note:** This section will be automatically updated by GitHub Actions.
